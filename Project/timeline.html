	<h1>Project Timeline</h1>
	<br />
	<p>
		As per the deadlines set by the university, the final submission will be
		done in week 11. Currently, this is week 4. And as I start building up the
		tools, I would have 6 weeks to complete the project. Following timeline is
		what I estimate would be followed in this project, in order to complete
		things on time:
